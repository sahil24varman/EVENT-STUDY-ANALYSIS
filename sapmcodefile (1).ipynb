        "# MARKET MODEL:  \n",
        "#  The market model says that the return on a security depends on the return\n",
        "#  on the market portfolio and the extent of the security's responsiveness\n",
        "#  as measured by beta. The return also depends on conditions that are unique \n",
        "#  to the firm. The market model can be graphed as a line fitted to a plot of \n",
        "#  asset returns against returns on the market portfolio. This relationship is \n",
        "#  sometimes called the single-index model.   \n",
        "  \n",
        "# Capital Asset Pricing Model\n",
        "# The most popular factor model is the single factor — Capital Asset Pricing\n",
        "#  Model or CAPM, which forms the basis of the Modern Portfolio Theory.\n",
        "# The CAPM, describes security’s risk as a function of it’s market exposure\n",
        "# or market Beta.\n",
        "#         Market Beta\n",
        "#         The Market Beta is a measure of the systematic risk of the security.\n",
        "#         In statistics, beta is the slope of the line which is obtained by \n",
        "#         regressing the returns of stock return with that of the market return.\n",
        "\n",
        "#         The Capital Asset Pricing Model is a financial model, which \n",
        "#         calculates expected returns as a function of the risk-free rate,\n",
        "#         market risk, and market returns.  Central to this model is the \n",
        "#         idea that returns are solely dictated by systematic risk.That is, \n",
        "#         if all market participants hold similar beliefs about expected\n",
        "#         returns nd the dispersion of returns, then only increases or\n",
        "#         decreases in market risk will change portfolio returns.\n",
        "\n",
        " # 3- FACTOR MODEL:\n",
        "# The Fama and French model has three factors: the size of firms, \n",
        "# # book-to-market values, and excess return on the market. \n",
        "# In other words, the three factors used are SMB (small minus big), \n",
        "# HML (high minus low), and the portfolio's return less the risk-free\n",
        "# rate of return. SMB accounts for publicly traded companies with small\n",
        "# market caps that generate higher returns, while HML accounts for value \n",
        "# stocks with high book-to-market ratios that generate higher returns in \n",
        "# comparison to the market.    \n",
        "# \n",
        "# 4- FACTOR MODEL:\n",
        "#The Monthly Momentum Factor(MOM) can be calculated by subtracting the equal\n",
        " # weighted average of the lowest performing firms from the equal weighed \n",
        " # average of the highest performing firms, lagged one month .\n",
        " # A stock would be considered to show momentum if its prior 12-month average of \n",
        " # returns is positive, or greater. Similar to the three factor model, momentum\n",
        " # factor is defined by self-financing portfolio of (long positive momentum)+\n",
        " # (short negative momentum). Momentum strategies continue to be popular in \n",
        " # financial markets. Financial analysts often incorporate the 52-week price\n",
        " # high/low in their Buy/Sell recommendations.\n",
        "  \n",
        "# 5- FACTOR MODEL: \n",
        "# In 2014, Fama and French adapted their model to include five factors. \n",
        "# Along with the original three factors, the new model adds the concept that\n",
        "# companies reporting higher future earnings have higher returns in the \n",
        "# stock market, a factor referred to as profitability. The fifth factor,\n",
